# CMSC436 Project Proposal: Theatr.io

## Project Team 10

 * Austin Hwa
 * Katie Kemp
 * Sahir Mody

## App Description

This app will allow a user to find movies near them and share their interests with their friends. A host can create a session with a date and time in mind and share the session id with their friends. Once joining the session, members can vote on what movie they want to see. Theaters are recommended based on GPS location.

## Minimal Goals

The app will contain a list theaters with movies showing nearby. A host can create a session and share with friends. Members of the session can vote on which movie they'd like to see. Votes are compiled and results are displayed.

## Stretch Goals

We have identified the following stretch goals:

 * Movie previews in app
 * Chat and commenting features
 * Recommendations based on history
 * Collect profile data

## Project Timeline
