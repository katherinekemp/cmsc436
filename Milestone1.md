# CMSC436 Milestone 1: Theatr

## Project Team 10

 * Austin Hwa
 * Katie Kemp
 * Sahir Mody

## App Description

This app will allow a user to find movies near them and share their interests with their friends. A host can create a session with a date and time in mind and share the session id with their friends. Once joining the session, members can vote on what movie they want to see. Theaters are recommended based on GPS location.

## Accomplished So Far

So far we have made the skeleton of our app, although we did not meet our original goal of importing the actual data from the Fandango API. We have looked into this and have a plan for implementing it for Milestone 2. The skeleton includes:

 * Basic homepage
 * Text box for sessions (not functional yet)
 * List of movies (test data)

## Updated Project Timeline

### Milestone 2

 * Import movie data from Fandango API and update movie list based on location/time
 * Session ids
 * Joining sessions

### Milestone 3

 * Voting
 * Results page

At this point, we will begin working on the stretch goals

### Final submission

Stretch goals completed, project submitted, and a demonstration
scheduled.

## Minimal Goals

The app will contain a list theaters with movies showing nearby. A host can create a session and share with friends. Members of the session can vote on which movie they'd like to see. Votes are compiled and results are displayed.

## Stretch Goals

We have identified the following stretch goals:

 * Movie previews in app
 * Chat and commenting features
 * Recommendations based on history
 * Collect profile data
