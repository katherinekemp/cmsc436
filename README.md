CMSC436 Group Project, Spring 2022

## About Theatr
For my handheld programming course, my team and I created a simple app using Swift. Our app automatically updates with the user's location to retrieve movies at nearby theaters. The user can start a voting session and friends can vote on which movie they would like to see. The winning movie is tabulated and results can then be saved. A link to purchase tickets can easily be shared via text, email, or any other app.

See [here](https://github.com/katherinekemp/cmsc436/blob/main/final_report.pdf) to read our report explaining our design process, [here](https://katherinekemp.com/DEMO.mov) for a demo of the app, and [here](https://github.com/katherinekemp/cmsc436/blob/main/theatr) to download the code.
